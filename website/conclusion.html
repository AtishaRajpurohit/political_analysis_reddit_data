            <p>
              The American people’s opinion on politics is an extremely difficult metric to judge and predict. News
              agencies and organizations such as FiveThirtyEight, CNN, and the Pew Research Center conduct polls and
              make bold predictions that often fall short of hitting their mark. But with the opinion of over
              three-hundred million Americans to take into account, it can be difficult to accurately predict how
              American’s feel towards political parties and politicians. Over the course of this project, we attempted
              to understand the subtle nuances represented by the American political system and those who are involved
              in it. Here, we set out twelve initial business goals to guide our analysis, and applied multiple tools
              and methods in order to accomplish them. </p>

            <p>
              Our first approach to answering the business goals was in the form of exploratory data analysis. Here, we
              applied the use of summary statistics, external data sources, and various data visualizations to
              understand the vast amount of data that we were working with. By doing so, we were able to draw four key
              insights regarding politics in the United States. To begin with, we were able to determine that discussion
              around politics online is very evenly balanced, with users in liberal and conservative forums posting on
              average the same amount per person. Secondly, we determined that people who identify more with the
              democratic party are more likely to consider arguments from an opposing viewpoint. In this case, the
              opposing viewpoint was from the subreddit r/Conservative. The plot below helps to illustrate this. The
              third goal we accomplished through exploratory data analysis was discerning what topics election
              candidates should cover by looking at popular political topics. Here, we found that the top three
              political topics for 2022 were gun control, taxation, and Covid-19. Lastly, we were able to determine the
              differences in reactions and sentiments of democrats and republicans towards President Biden.
            </p>

              <figcaption><b>Plot 1</b></figcaption>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Since the data we were working with was textual and contained the comments and submissions of tens of
              thousands of Reddit posts, it was clear to us that many of the goals we set out needed to be accomplished
              with methods other than basic summary statistics and data visualizations. Therefore, we decided to work
              with more advanced tools to tackle these difficult goals, hence, the use of NLP (natural language
              processing). Natural language processing was vital in our efforts and allowed us to realize four more of
              our business goals. To begin with, we found that through sentiment analysis, there wasn’t a significant
              difference in emotions expressed among supporters in different political groups. Thus, leading us to
              conclude that there isn’t a political group that displays more anger than others in the subreddits we
              analyzed. Secondly, we found that the way people discuss the president online is not representative of his
              approval rating. Third, we determined the most popular democrat and republican candidates for the 2024
              presidential election bid to be: Biden, Harris, Sanders, Trump, DeSantis, Youngkin. Finally, we determined
              the public’s opinion on how president Biden has handled important issues. The plot below shows how people
              associated with different political groups felt about these issues. Here, r/Politics represents a
              politically neutral person, r/Conservative represents someone associating more with the republican party,
              and r/Democrats for someone associating with the democratic party.</p>
            <figure>
              <figcaption><b>Plot 2</b></figcaption>
              <iframe src="../data/plots/sentiment_combined.html" width="100%" height="820"></iframe>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Even after applying the methods discussed above, there were still multiple business goals that were too
              complex and needed different tools to accomplish. Here, machine learning was applied to the data
              and we were able to generate models that allowed us to realize two more of our initial goals. The first
              goal that we achieved using machine learning was the ability to determine whether a comment in a subreddit
              would be considered controversial or not. This machine learning model was able to predict with 77%
              accuracy whether a comment posted in the r/Politics subreddit would be considered controversial or not.
              The confusion matrix from this model is displayed below. The second goal that we achieved using machine
              learning was the ability to determine whether a random comment is from a user who was either on the
              liberal or conservative side of the political spectrum. Although this model only generated a 62% accuracy,
              much lower than the previous model, we still considered this to be a positive outcome.</p>
            <figure>
              <figcaption><b>Plot 3</b></figcaption>
              <iframe src="../data/plots/confusion_matrix_abhishek.png" width="100%" height="740"></iframe>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>In the end, we were able to carry through on ten of the twelve initial business goals that we started
              with. Therefore, the immediate next steps for us will be in establishing proper methods to achieve the
              final two business goals: determining what it means for a person to be politically neutral in today's
              political climate and determining how socially and culturally different people with opposing political
              beliefs are. In addition, we plan on fine tuning the machine learning models that were generated. We
              believe this can be done by increasing the amount of training data, as well as fine-tuning hyperparameters
              within the models. </p>

            <br><br>
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-subtitle">Expanding the Analysis</h4>
            <p>To expand our analysis of predicting whether a comment is classfied as controversial or not in the machine learning section of the project we used random forest classifier in addition to the previously used linear regression model. The results of the random forest classifier were much better as compared to the linear regression model. As we can see from table 1 below, all the metrics that were used to calculate the performance of the machine learning model.
